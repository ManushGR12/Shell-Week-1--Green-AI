This will render in GitHub as a nicely formatted, fixed-width code block preserving spaces and lines, perfect for directory trees or code snippets.

For commands, use language like `bash`:

```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManushGR12/Shell-Week-1--Green-AI.git
cd Shell-Week-1--Green-AI
```
---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

-->git clone https://github.com/ManushGR12/Shell-Week-1--Green-AI.git
-->cd Shell-Week-1--Green-AI


### 2. Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt


> **Note:** For large files, [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used.  
> After cloning, run:

-->git lfs install
-->git lfs pull


---

### 3. Run the Data Preprocessing Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook from the project root:

jupyter notebook notebooks/01_data_preprocessing.ipynb


- The notebook loads datasets from `data/raw/`.  
- Preprocessed files are saved to `data/processed/`.

---

### 4. Add Your Own Datasets (Optional)

- Place any new datasets inside the `data/raw/` folder.  
- Update notebook paths only if you change the folder structure.

---

## 🛠 How It Works

The preprocessing notebook performs:

- Data loading (`data/raw/`)  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Encoding and scaling  
- Train-test splits  
- Saving processed datasets for modeling

---

## 📝 Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (installed via `requirements.txt`)  
- Git LFS (for large files)

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Missing data files?**  
  Run `git lfs pull` after cloning to fetch large datasets.  
- **File not found errors?**  
  Ensure your folder structure matches above.  
- For new issues, [open an issue](https://github.com/ManushGR12/Shell-Week-1--Green-AI/issues).
